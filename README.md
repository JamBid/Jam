# Jam Bidding

A real-time application that provides a way to bid on an item, or even allow a user to post an item to be up for auction.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
node (8.9.1) or later
```

### Installing

Install the required packages to help you build the app.

```
run `npm install -g create-react-app`
run `npm install -g yarn`
```

Navigate to the folder where you would like to store the app. In that folder, run the following command:

```
run `npm create-react-app jam`
cd jam
run `git clone https://github.com/JamBid/Jam.git` (If there are errors due to permission, download the repo as a zip and replace the files in the jam folder with the ones from the zip.)
run `yarn install`
```

To run the app locally, use the following command:
```
yarn dev
```
